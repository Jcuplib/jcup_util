# jcup_util
Miscellaneous utilities for Jcup and others.

This library is intended to be used by Jcup, as well as to be used by any other programs/libraries of your own.

As you can see, there still nothing here at present.

We plan to add modules like below;
- time/date/calendar handling,
- file I/O, logging,
- what else ?

If you have any suggestion/comment/opinion, please open new issue on this site.
